## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd portfolio-freelance
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables (`backend/.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying `.env.example` and filling in your details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Atlas Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_complex

# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1 # e.g., ap-south-1, us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name_here

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Admin Credentials (for initial setup - used by the backend to create the first admin user if needed)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password_here
```

#### External Services Configuration

*   **MongoDB Atlas**:
    1.  Create an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
    2.  Set up a new cluster.
    3.  Obtain your connection string and update `MONGO_URI` in your `backend/.env` file.
*   **AWS S3 (for image uploads)**:
    1.  Create an AWS account.
    2.  Create an S3 bucket (e.g., in `ap-south-1` region).
    3.  Create an IAM user with programmatic access and S3 permissions (e.g., `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`).
    4.  Update `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and `S3_BUCKET_NAME` in your `backend/.env` file.

#### Run Backend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified `PORT`).

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate to the project root (where `package.json` for the frontend is), install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd .. # If you are still in the backend directory
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the project root (frontend directory) by copying `.env.example` and filling in your details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
**Note**: Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` matches your backend server's address and port.

#### Run Frontend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
